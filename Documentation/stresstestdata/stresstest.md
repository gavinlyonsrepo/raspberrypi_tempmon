### CPU temperature stress test on a RPi using **rpi_tempmon.py** program.


Specifications: Raspberry pi 3 model B, running Raspbian 8.0 jessie.
Offical Standard Rpi plastic case from Rpi store.

The CPU will be stressed and temperature measurements taken and graphed for
a variety of cooling solutions.
ARM CPU temperature measurements by software **[rpi_tempmon.py](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/raspberrypi_tempmon)** stress test  option.
Rpi_tempmon uses the sysbench benchmarking tool to stress CPU.
The CPU stress test consists of calculation of prime numbers up to a value of 20000. 
All calculations are performed using 64-bit integers. 4 worker threads are created.
CPU temperature and freq are recorded for each test run and graphed.
5 test iterations per test. Test duration: 10 minutes took 12 for test 1 due to ,
thermal throttling slowing down CPU.

The first graph is created in libreoffice calc by using CSV(comma separted values) 
log file data produced by **rpi_tempmon.py** during testing.
The other graphs are generated by rpi_tempmon.py at end of testrun.

* Test 1 - No Heatsink .
* Test 2 - small Heatsink 13 by 15 by 7 (mm).
* Test 3 - Small + medium Heatsink 16 by 22 by 7 (mm).
* Test 4 - Small + medium + large heatsink  35 by 35 by 22 (mm).
* Test 5 - Small Heatsink + 60mm fan running at 5V.
* Test 6 - Small heatsink + 80mm fan running at 9V.

* All Data graph.
